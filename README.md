# Liber-tad (Troy Web Consulting technical Assessment)

If you don't want to install everything it's hosted [libertad.danielchung.dev](https://libertad.danielchung.dev/)

Liber stands for "book" in Latin and libertad in Spanish means "freedom". So the name stands for the freedom of books as I believe education should be free.

This website is for the Troy Web Development technical assessment. Due to the time limit, I was unable to make it mobile responsive, in the future I will keep in mind to design mobile first. That being said I was able to accomplish all the features that were required and add the bonus requirements. On top of that, I also came up with a interesting way of developing this application, however, it wouldn't have satisfied a lot of the features that were required, so instead, I had to scratch it and work on this simpler interface. I will attach a small demo of what it looked like as I think it was interesting. (This can be found in the abbout page [here](https://libertad.danielchung.dev/about) or you can keep reading below).
